# Link-Shortener-website

This project is a learning solution from [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/link-shortener-website-brqjanf6zq).

## Project Requirements

The user will input a valid URL and click a "shorten" button. The shortened URL will then be displayed.

Your UI should include the following elements:

* Text input for the user's URL
* "Shorten" button to trigger the link shortening
* Display area to return the shortened URL to the user

### Bonus Requirements

* Make it easier for the user to copy the shortened URL by adding a "copy" button for one-click copying.
* Try to allow the user to automatically copy the shortened URL by using libraries like SimpleCopy or ClipboardJS.
